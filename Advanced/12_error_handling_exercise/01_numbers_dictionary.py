"""
You are provided with the following code:

numbers_dictionary = {}

line = input()

while line != "Search":
    number_as_string = line
    number = int(input())
    numbers_dictionary[number_as_string] = number

line = input()

while line != "Remove":
    searched = line
    print(numbers_dictionary[searched])

line = input()

while line != "End":
    searched = line
    del numbers_dictionary[searched]

print(numbers_dictionary)

•	On the first several lines, until you receive the command "Search", you will receive on separate lines the number
as a text and the number as an integer
•	When you receive "Search" on the next several lines until you receive the command "Remove", you will be given
the searched number as a text, and you need to print it on the console
•	When you receive "Remove" on the next several lines until you receive "End", you will be given the searched number
as a text, and you need to remove it from the dictionary
•	In the end, you need to print what is left from the dictionary
There is some missing code in the solution, and some errors may occur. Complete the code, so the following errors
are handled:
•	Passing non-integer type to the variable number
•	Searching for a non-existent number
•	Removing a non-existent number
Print appropriate messages when an error has occurred. The messages should be:
•	"The variable number must be an integer"
•	"Number does not exist in dictionary" - for non-existing keys
